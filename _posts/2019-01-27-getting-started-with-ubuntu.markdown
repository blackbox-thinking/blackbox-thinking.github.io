One thing that stood out to me after reading the "Python Developers Survey 2018" by JetBrains was that almost 70% of survey responders said they used Linux as their development environment operating system. This puts a huge dent in the myth that Windows or MacOS are top development platforms. So if you've not sure why or how to give Linux a try we'll take you through the basics.
