I was working with a customer a while ago when a system upgrade to patch a security vulnerability did not go as planned. While restoring the users profiles and workspaces we realised that the backup had become corrupted and it dawned upon us that most user accounts had been lost.

This is how the events of that upgrade played out. There were a number of failures and lessons learnt but also some key successes that we'll also discuss.

More to come ...
