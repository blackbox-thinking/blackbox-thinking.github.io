          Hi, I'm Abid. I've enjoyed working in the technology sector for over 20 years.
          I've benefited from working along side very talented individuals in some of the largest companies in the world.
          I've taught myself most of the skills I use today and now I'm going to teach you how you can succeed with
          technology in your business, career and hobbies in the same way I have.

      <p>Blackbox Thinking started as a freelance technology consultancy. I started it when I got fed up of working freelance through an agency
      and wanted to take more control of how and what direction my work took me.</p>
      <p>
      I've worked in the tech sector for over two decades and felt I had something I could give back to people wanting to work in IT or want to us learn skills to benefit their own businesses, careers or hobbies.
      I needed a medium that would reach a bigger audience. I needed to find people who genuinely wanted to learn mastery in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>That medium is here. That person is you.</strong>
